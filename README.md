Islamy Flutter Application is my first flutter project. I have applied multiple feature in this app. Some of these features are:
--> Quran Tab: containing all the Quran suras and their verses numbers, when you click on the SuraName, you will be able to read its content.
--> Hadeth Tab: containing about 50 different Prophet's ahadeth, when you click on the hadeth, you will be able to read its content.
--> Sebha Tab: containing a Sebha which is used to say azkars.
--> Radio Tab: ...
--> Settings Tab: A tab where you can change the theme of the whole application between dark and light mode, and you can change the language of the application between arabic and english.
--> Made two different designs one for dark theme and other for light theme.
